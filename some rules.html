            <p>Dungeons and dragons for such an open ended game it has its rule as any other game would. But the rules are more for the playes to know the bounds of their abilities and how to use them. For an example a wizard would not be able to use most heavy wepons due to his striengt being to low or a barberian would not be able to use a dagger as well as rogue.</p>

            <p>There is verius rule books but for beginers it is advised to start whit the Players Hand Book, for the fanasy adventure.As the other rule books add more extentions to the core classes and races (some add other races too).

            <p>The rules revolve manly on youre character stats,items,abilities and spells. Thes stats are the builing blocks of youre character and derectly effect the succes rate of youre ability rolls and how proficient you are at your skills. Some of your actions in the game will require you to make a skill check, which requires you to roll a 20 sided dice and depending on how high youre modifier is and how high your roll is will depend if you succeded on youre action. For example if I were to attak an enemy I would have to roll the 20 sided dice and see how good I am at my wepon and if I roll higher than his armor my strike will be succesful.Or if I wanted to lie to my adversary out of combat I would have to roll the 20 sided dice and see how cunning my character is which is based on your charisma.</p>
